# Predicting Political Bias Using Artificial Neural Neworks
This is a deep learning class assignment where we use a simple feed forward artificial neural netwroks to identify the political bias in the tweets towards Democratic or Republican party.
We experiment with different hyperparameters such as different layers, activation functions, dropout layers and optimisers to understand their effects and finally meet the objective of building a good classification model
