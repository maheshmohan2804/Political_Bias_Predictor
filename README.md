Predicting Political Bias Using Artificial Neural Neworks
In this project we use a simple feed forward artificial neural netwroks to identify the political bias in the tweets towards Democratic or Republican party.
We experiment with different hyperparameters such as different layers, activation functions, dropout layers and optimisers to understand their effects and finally meet the objective of cuilding a good classification model
